Instagram Polaroider
===================

Grabs a load of images from an Instagram feed and displays them nicely on the page.

Uses some code from https://github.com/duplikey/instatake to actually grab the images.
CSS adapted from http://zurb.com/playground/css3-polaroids to make them look a bit like Polaroids.
